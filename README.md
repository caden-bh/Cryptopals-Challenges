# Cryptopals-Challenges
Answers to the cryptography challenges found at https://www.cryptopals.com/

A couple things of note:
  1) I come from a math background and I don't have nearly as much coding experience as I would like. As a result, I'm sure that a lot of my code could be done in a much more efficient manner, whether that be in conciseness or runtime. Any advice/constructive criticism on ways to improve my code would be appreciated.
  2) I am sure that there are many other answers to these excercises that I could easily find, but I am working on them to gain a better understanding of cryptographic protocols. Any recommendations on other resources that would help would also be appreciated.
